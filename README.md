#  House Price Prediction

This dataset is downloaded from kaggle at this URL "https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data".
We will be using this dataset to do analysis and regression to predict the sale price of the houses .

We will be doing Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering and Regression on the datasets.

## Installation

We will be using the standard inbuilt anaconda package installation. We will use python packages such as NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn,
matplotlib and Scikit learn for the mentioned activities.

```sh
$ import pandas as pd
$ import numpy as np
$ import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
$ import seaborn as sns
$ %matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
